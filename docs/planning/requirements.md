# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GitHub Issues Discord Threads Bot is a bidirectional synchronization system between Discord forum channels and GitHub repository issues. Currently limited to a single repository-channel mapping, this document outlines requirements for enhancing the system to support multiple repository management within a single bot instance. The enhancement will enable development teams to manage multiple GitHub repositories across different Discord channels, maintaining isolated synchronization for each mapping while sharing a single bot infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multiple Repository-Channel Mapping Support

**User Story:** As a development team administrator, I want to configure multiple Discord channels to sync with different GitHub repositories, so that I can manage all my projects from a single Discord server without running multiple bot instances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bot instance is started THEN the system SHALL support at least 10 concurrent repository-channel mappings
2. IF a Discord channel is configured with a repository mapping THEN the system SHALL only synchronize that channel with its designated repository
3. WHEN an event occurs in a mapped Discord channel THEN the system SHALL only affect the corresponding GitHub repository
4. IF a GitHub webhook is received THEN the system SHALL identify the source repository and route it to the correct Discord channel
5. WHEN multiple mappings are active THEN the system SHALL maintain complete isolation between different repository-channel pairs

### Requirement 2: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure repository mappings through a JSON configuration file, so that I can easily manage multiple repositories in a centralized configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot starts THEN the system SHALL read configuration from a config.json file
2. WHEN a config.json file is provided THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields (discord_token, github_access_token, mappings)
3. IF a configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific issues
4. WHEN adding a new repository mapping to config.json THEN the system SHALL require channel_id, repository owner, and repository name fields
5. IF a mapping includes a webhook_secret field THEN the system SHALL use it for signature validation

### Requirement 3: Data Store Isolation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each repository-channel mapping to have its own isolated data store, so that thread and issue data from different projects don't interfere with each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new mapping is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a separate Store instance for that mapping
2. IF a thread is created in Channel A THEN the system SHALL NOT affect the thread list in Channel B's store
3. WHEN accessing thread data THEN the system SHALL retrieve it from the store associated with the requesting channel
4. IF an error occurs in one store THEN the system SHALL NOT affect the operation of other stores
5. WHEN the bot starts THEN the system SHALL initialize all stores with their respective GitHub issues

### Requirement 4: Webhook Processing and Routing

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to use a single webhook endpoint for all repositories, so that I don't need to configure multiple webhook URLs in GitHub.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GitHub webhook is received THEN the system SHALL extract the repository information from the payload
2. IF the repository in the webhook payload matches a configured mapping THEN the system SHALL process the webhook
3. IF the repository in the webhook payload does NOT match any mapping THEN the system SHALL return a 404 status
4. WHEN webhook secret validation is configured for a mapping THEN the system SHALL verify the signature before processing
5. IF webhook signature validation fails THEN the system SHALL return a 401 status and log the security event

### Requirement 5: Discord Event Handling

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want the bot to only respond to events in configured channels, so that it doesn't interfere with unrelated forum channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Discord thread is created THEN the system SHALL check if the parent channel has a repository mapping
2. IF a Discord event occurs in an unmapped channel THEN the system SHALL ignore the event
3. WHEN processing a Discord event THEN the system SHALL use the repository credentials associated with that channel
4. IF a message is posted in a mapped thread THEN the system SHALL create a GitHub comment in the correct repository
5. WHEN a thread is archived in a mapped channel THEN the system SHALL close the issue in the corresponding repository

### Requirement 6: GitHub API Operations

**User Story:** As a GitHub repository maintainer, I want the bot to correctly target different repositories based on the channel context, so that issues and comments are created in the right repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a GitHub issue THEN the system SHALL use the repository owner and name from the channel's mapping
2. IF a GitHub API call is made THEN the system SHALL include the correct repository credentials from the mapping context
3. WHEN fetching issues on startup THEN the system SHALL query each configured repository separately
4. IF an API rate limit is encountered for one repository THEN the system SHALL continue operating for other repositories
5. WHEN deleting an issue THEN the system SHALL use the GraphQL API with the correct repository context

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed logging that identifies which repository-channel mapping generated each log entry, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging an action THEN the system SHALL include the channel ID and repository name in the log message
2. IF an error occurs in one mapping THEN the system SHALL log the error without stopping other mappings
3. WHEN a critical error occurs THEN the system SHALL identify which mapping caused the failure
4. IF a mapping fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL continue initializing other mappings
5. WHEN displaying URLs in logs THEN the system SHALL show both Discord and GitHub URLs for the affected resources

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a bot operator, I want the system to efficiently handle multiple repositories without significant performance degradation, so that synchronization remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling 10 concurrent mappings THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 2 seconds
2. IF memory usage exceeds reasonable limits THEN the system SHALL log warnings about resource consumption
3. WHEN processing events THEN the system SHALL handle them asynchronously to prevent blocking
4. IF multiple events occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process them in parallel where safe
5. WHEN caching Discord data THEN the system SHALL maintain separate caches per mapping

### Requirement 9: Security

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want each repository mapping to be securely isolated, so that a compromise in one mapping doesn't affect others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing webhook secrets THEN the system SHALL keep them separate per mapping
2. IF a webhook secret is configured THEN the system SHALL validate signatures for that repository
3. WHEN accessing GitHub APIs THEN the system SHALL use the same token but respect repository boundaries
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the security event with full context
5. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL never log tokens or secrets

### Requirement 10: Monitoring and Health Checks

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want to monitor the health of each repository mapping, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot is running THEN the system SHALL expose health status for each mapping
2. IF a mapping becomes unhealthy THEN the system SHALL log detailed diagnostic information
3. WHEN a health check is requested THEN the system SHALL report the status of all mappings
4. IF a mapping fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff for retries
5. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the system SHALL track metrics per mapping (event counts, error rates, response times)

### Requirement 11: Future Extensibility

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want the multi-repository system to be designed for future enhancements, so that we can add features without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the MultiStore class THEN the system SHALL use interfaces that support future persistence layers
2. IF dynamic configuration is added in the future THEN the system SHALL support it without breaking changes
3. WHEN designing the mapping structure THEN the system SHALL include an ID field for future reference
4. IF webhook endpoints need modification THEN the system SHALL support multiple endpoint patterns
5. WHEN structuring the codebase THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation between mapping logic and core functionality
